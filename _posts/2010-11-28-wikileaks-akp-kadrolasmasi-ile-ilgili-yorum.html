<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Moreover, the authority  of AKP's nationwide party machine is blurring with the  Turkish State's executive power at the provincial and  district level and with municipal functions to an extent not  seen since the days of the one-party state.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the same time the government must reportedly hire  a couple thousand people skilled in English or other major EU  languages and up to the bureaucratic demands of interfacing  with the Eurocrats who descend on ministries as harmonization  starts.  If the government continues to hire on the basis of  "one of us", i.e., from the Sunni brotherhood and lodge  milieu that has been serving as the pool for AKP's civil  service hiring, lack of competence will be a problem.  If the  government hires on the base of competence, its new hires  will be frustrated by the incompetence of AKP's previous  hires at all levels.</p>
