<p>Until today, the only footage online was the trailer which intentionally makes it clear that Banksy doesn't want to give too of the film's storyline away<br />
Banksy says in the clip: "The film is the story of what happens when his guy tried to make a documentary about me but he was a lot more interesting than I am, so the film is now kinda about him."</p>
