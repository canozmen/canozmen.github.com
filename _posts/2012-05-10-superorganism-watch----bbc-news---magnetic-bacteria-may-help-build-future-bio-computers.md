> A team from the UK's University of Leeds and Japan's Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology have used microbes that eat iron.
> 
> As they ingest the iron, the microbes create tiny magnets inside themselves, similar to those in PC hard drives.
> 
> The research may lead to the creation of much faster hard drives, the team of scientists say.
> ...
> Besides using microorganisms to produce magnets, the researchers also managed to create tiny electrical wires from living organisms.
>
> They created nano-scale tubes made from the membrane of cells, grown in a lab-controlled environment with the help of a protein present in human lipid molecules.
>
> A membrane is a biological film-like "wall" that separates a cell's interior from the outside environment.
>
> Such tubes could in future be used as microscopic bio-engineered wires, capable of transferring information - just like cells do in our bodies - inside a computer, Dr Masayoshi Tanaka from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology told the BBC.
