<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Fiction</strong>: &nbsp;There's a great US TV show called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/" target="_self">Breaking Bad</a>. &nbsp;The summary for the show reads: &nbsp;Informed he has terminal cancer, an underachieving chemistry genius turned high school chemistry teacher turns to using his expertise in chemistry to provide a financial nest egg for his family... by producing high quality crystal meth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Truth</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://articles.boston.com/2011-12-06/yourtown/30482612_1_face-charges-school-zone-adjunct" target="_self">A 74 year old adjunct Math professor</a> from Boston University was accused of running a meth lab in her home (which is located near city hall and inside a school zone). &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Almost certainly for the same reason as the fictional show: &nbsp;money. &nbsp;Adjunct professors in US Universities can make as little as $10 an hour (forget retirement and health care). &nbsp;</p>
