<p>Need proof that green technology is a lucrative industry? Look no further than Italy, where the Mafia (AKA the “lords of the wind”) has infiltrated the <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2010/02/05/turbine-light-powers-highway-lights-with-wind/" target="_blank">wind</a> power business. Fraud is rampant in Sicilian mob strongholds like Corleone, where the Mafia owns many wind farms. The reason: power from <a href="http://inhabitat.com/2010/09/09/europes-largest-onshore-wind-farm-to-get-even-bigger/" target="_blank">wind</a> farms is sold at a high rate because of generous government subsidies intended to expand the renewable energy sector. All the mob has to do is buy off local politicians and voila, the Mafia owns the lucrative wind power business.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Devletin üretilen elektriği iyi bir fiyata alma garantisi vermesini fırsat bilip rüzgar işine el atmışlar. Türkiye'de de var bu kanunlar. Burda da yakındır.</p></div>
