<p>...</p>
<p>At the time <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6969812.stm">Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship</a>. The regime had a cynical slogan aimed at silencing dissent: “Brazil – love it or leave it”.</p>
<p>Socrates had an alternative – change it. He was the leading light in a movement at the club which became known as “Corinthians Democracy”. Players, coaching staff and club employees would vote on all kinds of issues of interest to the collective – from which players to sign, to whether the team bus should stop to allow people to get off and relieve themselves.</p>
<p>This was successful in football terms, transforming a struggling team into a cohesive, victorious unit. <a href="http://au.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/12241413/corinthians-win-fifth-brazilian-title/">Corinthians won the Sao Paulo State Championship in 1982 and 83</a>, a time when the title still meant something.</p>
<p>More than that though, the movement served an educational purpose for millions – imparting the value and virtues of democracy at a time when they were seen as dangerously subversive.</p>
<p>It was an embryo of a future, better Brazil. This is why Brazil’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7314686/socrates-brazil-captain-1982-world-cup-dies-57">president Dilma Rousseff, herself a victim of the military government, referred to Socrates as “a champion of citizenship</a>” on Sunday.</p>
