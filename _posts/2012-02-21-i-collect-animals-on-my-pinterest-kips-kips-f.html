      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Reflecting on the current Internet darling <a href="http://pinterest.com" title="Pinterest" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, it occurred to me, that Pinterest might well be the first articulation of Kipple. Here’s a short piece from the book, where you could fairly easily replace the word Kipple for its real-world equivalent:</p>
<p><strong>From Philip K Dick’s “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” </strong></p><p>JR - Kipple (Pinterest) is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders  after you use the last match or gum wrappers of yesterday’s homeopape.  When nobody’s around, kipple (Pinterest) reproduces itself. For instance, if you go  to bed leaving any kipple (Pinterest) around your apartment, when you wake up the  next morning there’s twice as much of it. It always gets more and more.</p>
<p><br />Pris- I see.</p>
<p><br />JR - There’s the First Law of Kipple (Pinterest), “Kipple (Pinterest) drives out nonkipple (Non-Pinterest).”  Like Gresham’s law about bad money. And in these apartments there’s  been nobody there to fight the kipple (Pinterest).</p>
<p><br />Pris - So it has taken over completely. Now I understand.</p>
<p><br />JR - Your place, here, this apartment you’ve picked - it’s too  kipple-ized (Pinterest-ized) to live in. We can roll the kipple-factor (Pinterest-factor) back; we can do  like I said, raid the other apartments. But -</p>
<p><br />Pris - But what?</p>
<p><br />JR - We can’t win.</p>
<p><br />Pris - Why not?</p>
<p><br />JR - No one can win against kipple (Pinterest), except temporarily and maybe in  one spot, like in my apartment I’ve sort of created a stasis between the  pressure of kipple (Pinterest) and nonkipple (non-(Pinterest), for the time being. But eventually  I’ll die or go away, and then the kipple (Pinterest) will again take over. It’s a  universal principle operating throughout the universe; the entire  universe is moving toward a final state of total, absolute  kippleization (Pinterestization).</p></blockquote>
