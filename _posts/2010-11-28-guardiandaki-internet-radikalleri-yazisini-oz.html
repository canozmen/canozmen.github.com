<h3><strong>CHRISTOPHER "MOOT" POOLE – 4CHAN</strong></h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290781793590/cyber-Moot-001.jpg" height="232" alt="cyber

<p>...</p>
<p><strong>The site is
distinctive because users can post material anonymously, and some users have also organised themselves as a collective, using the name
"Anonymous". What does that actually mean?</strong><br />As recently as six years ago, people were used to forums where you could lurk,
you could view, but in order to post and participate, you had to register. Because you didn't need to register on 4chan, people started
to appreciate it, and realise how radically different it was. We began to see anonymity not just as an aspect or feature, but as a
thing, as a principle, as an idea that we are one, we are a collective, we are Anonymous. People then came to the site who not only saw
Anonymous as a principle, but started to exploit anonymity as a new platform where they could be rebellious and no one knew who they
were.</p>
<p>...</p><p>
<strong>Why?</strong><br />Anonymity allows you to express and view opinions, images you wouldn't
necessarily be comfortable with elsewhere. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to be negative. It's not about, "You can't say fuck on
Facebook&nbsp;but you can on 4chan." Services where you have a persistent, registered identity such as Twitter and Facebook – in many
cases it's your real identity – limit what users want to say and read. But you can on 4chan. It is an&nbsp;outlet. I was invited to
speak at Facebook to provide an alternative and opposite perspective to theirs. Mark Zuckerberg's point of view is that anonymity and
monikers and pseudo-identity represents cowardice. He said that if you have nothing to hide, what's the big deal? Why would you be
concerned about putting all this stuff on your profile? Well, I'm not a zealot and people like what Facebook is doing. But there is a
place for both. They both&nbsp;offer powerful utilities for different needs.&nbsp;The world still needs a Google,&nbsp;and Facebook. But
it also needs&nbsp;the anonymous, ephemeral, open 4chan.</p><p><strong>Are there any rules?</strong><br />There is a set of codified rules
and we&nbsp;do enforce them: don't break the&nbsp;law or post anything illegal. Past that, the users are left to their own
devices.</p><h3>ORY OKOLLOH - USHAHIDI</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290781977254/cyber-Ory-001.jpg" height="250" alt="cyber Ory" width="200" /> <span style=""> Ory Okolloh, founder of Ushahidi.

activist, lawyer and blogger, and co-founder of <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>, a crowdsourcing technology. She is 33
and now lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. </strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Where will the web have its greatest effect over the next 10
years?</strong><br />No question: Africa.</p><h3>JODY McINTYRE – LIFE ON WHEELS</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290782561257/cyber-Jody-008.jpg" height="260" alt="cyber

</span> <p><strong>A 20-year old British blogger and author of the site <a href="http://jodymcintyre.wordpress.com/">Life on Wheels</a>,
Jody was born disabled and campaigns worldwide for justice in Palestine.</strong></p><p><strong>Where does Life on Wheels come
from?</strong><br />The site was born out of anger and frustration – as with the birth of every revolutionary movement. Essentially, I was
going to college every morning and bus drivers wouldn't let me on the bus because I was in a wheelchair. So in response to these
feelings, I began writing the blog, detailing my experiences.</p>
<p>...</p>
<h3>HAN HAN – BLOGGER</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/Gallery_Images/2010/11/26/1290787796456/Cyber-Han-Han-001.jpg" height="268" alt="Cyber Han Han" width="200" /> <span style=""> Han Han a professional rally driver, bestselling author, singer, creator of a literary

rally driver, bestselling author, singer, creator of a literary magazine and China's most popular <a href="http://www.hanhandigest.com/">blogger </a>– indeed, possibly the most popular blogger in the world.</strong></p><p><strong>What
are your greatest criticisms of the Chinese government and the current political climate there?</strong><br />The Chinese Communist party
puts keeping their political position first above everything. Of course, this is the wish of many political parties around the world.
For the Chinese government, the reality is that regardless of whether the people are satisfied or unsatisfied, the party's position will
always be secure. However, they are sometimes nervous, sometimes arrogant and this attitude has caused many
tragedies.</p>

<h3>PETER SUNDE – THE PIRATE BAY</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290782169412/cyber-Sunde-001.jpg" height="250" alt="cyber

</span> <p><strong>The 32-year old Swedish co-founder of the <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>, the world's leading
file-sharing site, allowing users to exchange music, games, videos and more. Found guilty, along with his colleagues, of assisting
others in copyright infringement in 2009; lost his appeal last week (after this interview took place) and now faces eight months in jail
and a fine shared with his colleagues of £4.1m.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>What philosophy lay behind your attitude?</strong><br />We were influenced by Public Enemy and the
KLF. And by traditional French philosophers, rather than by any US west coast libertarians.</p><p><strong>What makes you think that the
free sharing of files online can be right?</strong><br />I grew up with computers. I got my first computer when I was nine, and everything
I learned about computers was from copies. I wouldn't be able to program if it wasn't for illegally copying my first programming
language compiler.</p>

<h3>WALID AL-SAQAF –
YEMEN PORTAL</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290782808118/cyber-Walid-001.jpg" height="249" alt="cyber
Walid" width="200" /> <span style=""> Walid al-Saqaf, creator of Yemen Portal. Photograph: James Duncan Davidson/TED </span> </span>
<p><strong>The 37-year old Yemeni activist is the creator of <a href="http://yemenportal.net/">Yemen Portal</a> and of software used to
circumvent firewalls.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>How did
the government respond to the fact that an increasing readership was discovering dissident content through Yemen
Portal?</strong><br />They simply blocked access to it, to the whole site from within Yemen. So I had three choices: give way and let the
government control what did and didn't appear on my site; shut it down altogether; or keep the controversial content and find ways to
allow people to access the site. I chose the latter, because I felt it would have been a betrayal to my professsion to manipulate what
people see. I developed a piece of software called alkasir. If you were browsing the net and wanted to open your Gmail, your Gmail would
go through the regular internet service provider. But when you open a blocked website, it activates itself and changes into the
encrypted proxy mode. That's better than anonymising everything because if you do that, you give the impression to the monitors at the
ISP that there is a fishy connection.</p><h3>TOM STEINBERG – MYSOCIETY</h3> <span> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290783068270/cyber-Tom-008.jpg" height="240" alt="cyber Tom" width="200" /> <span style=""> Tom Steinberg, founder of mySociety. Photograph: Anna Gordon for the Guardian </span> </span>
<p><strong>The 33-year old founder of <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, which has developed websites in the UK
including TheyWorkForYou and WriteToThem, aiming to bring greater transparency to government.</strong></p><p><strong>What is
mySociety?</strong><br />MySociety builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and democratic parts of their
lives. We run various democracy and transparency sites in the UK that do things like make it really easy to find out how your
politicians voted or, on a more local level, help you report problems to the council, such as potholes and broken streetlights, or get
information out of government that you might want via the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Are you trying to
transform local politics?</strong><br />It would be lovely if measurably more people in the future felt they could realistically be part
of the solution if there was some problem in their community, that it's not just something unimaginably over their heads that's dealt
with by another class of people that they never meet. I am out to give as many people as I can a better experience of dealing with the
democracy they live in and the government that rules over them.</p>
