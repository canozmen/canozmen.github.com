> Certain strains of bacteria absorb iron to make magnetic nanoparticles that let them navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. The team have extracted the protein behind this process and used it to create magnetic patterns that can store data. "We're using and abusing nature because it's had billions of years to do all of its experiments through evolution, so there is almost no point in us starting from scratch," says Sarah Staniland, who led the research (Small, vol 8, p  204).:
