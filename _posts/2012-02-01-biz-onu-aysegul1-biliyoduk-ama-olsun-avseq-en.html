<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><em>AVSEQ</em> (pronounced ay-vee-seck, I'm told) stands for Audiovisual Sequencer, putting it in a class of abstract, interactive audiovisual experiments that runs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29">Simon</a> all the way through and past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplankton"><em>Electroplankton</em></a>. It's a tough game to evaluate as a whole, though, because the "audiovisual" portion and the "sequencer" portion, both interesting in their own right, fail to mesh together in a satisfying way and each seem to actively work against the enjoyment of the other.</blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2012/01/avseq-engaging-gem-matching-fails-to-mesh-with-trippy-musical-visualizations.ars">arstechnica.com</a></div>
