Called "Не Підведи" (Not Fail), here's the plot <a href="http://europopped.com/lamaukraines-insane-new-cyborg-clip">according to Europopped's Charlie Amter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's the year 2034. A secret lab has developed a "bioprototype." It's job is to control people's feelings (duh!). And because it's Ukraine, the bioprototype is (of course) a hot woman.</p>
</blockquote>
