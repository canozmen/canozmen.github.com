<blockquote>
<h2>Drug Arbitrage </h2>
<p>Companies like EurimPharm work much as arbitrageurs do in
the financial markets. Instead of trading stocks or bonds, the
drug arbitrageurs buy prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals from European countries where they cost less,
such as Spain and Greece. </p>
<p>They repackage and resell them at a markup in more-
expensive European markets, including Germany and the
Netherlands. </p>
<p>The arbitrageurs’ profit comes from country-to-country
price differences that can be hefty. A Europe-wide price survey
in 2009 by a Spanish parallel trader showed price differentials
that in a few cases topped 200 percent. Mohringer says such
margins are unheard of in his industry. </p>
