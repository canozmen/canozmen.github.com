</p><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><div>The world desperately needs a new form of capitalism. One that
would trump the version we're living with, which I've named "Gucci
capitalism" because it overvalues status and undervalues equity.
We're more ashamed not to have a new Gucci handbag (or any luxe
brand, come to that) than to get in debt. The ideal replacement,
"co-op capitalism", prioritises collective destiny. It would value
the network and see connectivity as a social, political and <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/03/ellen-macarthur-champions-circle-economy-approach">
economic</a> goal. It would recognise the import of relationships
-- and understand that how an exchange takes place impacts upon its
outcome. It would prioritise social cohesion.</div>

<p>Whereas Gucci capitalism was about beggar thy neighbour, co-op
capitalism recognises that collaboration can trump competition.
Where Gucci capitalism was about individual success, co-op
capitalism is about our collective future and interdependencies.
Gucci capitalism was all about people serving capital; co-op
capitalism is about people sharing the spoils of capitalism in an
equitable fashion. The co-op model may well resonate much closer
with our true natures than Gucci capitalism did. The assumption of
Gucci capitalism -- that we're selfish, super-individualistic
beings who care only about maximising our wealth, salaries and
resources -- turns out to be more a failing of mainstream
economists than an accurate depiction of us.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/04/ideas-bank/noreena-hertz">wired.co.uk</a></div>
