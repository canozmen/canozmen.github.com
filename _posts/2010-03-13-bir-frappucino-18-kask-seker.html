<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>A venture capitalist who knows the business intimately cited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks" title="">Starbucks</a> as a company that has recognised and responded brilliantly to a cultural need. The caffeine and sugar in the coffee, with their energising effects, are certainly part of the equation, but the chain also offers something much more primal. "It's about warm milk and a bottle," he says. "One of my colleagues said, 'If I could put a nipple on it, I'd be a multimillionaire'."</p><p>But it was thinking creatively about how to attract more consumers that led Starbucks to the <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/menu/catalog/product?drink=frappuccino-blended-beverages" title="">Frappuccino</a>, the venture capitalist told me. Although its stores were crowded early in the day, by afternoon "they were so empty you could roll a bowling ball through them". The creation of a&nbsp;rich, sweet and comforting milkshake-like concoction utterly transformed the business. A&nbsp;Starbucks Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino comes with whipped cream and 18 teaspoons of sugar: all in all, this "drink" contains more calories than a personal-size pepperoni pizza, and more sweetness than six scoops of ice-cream. By encouraging us to consider any occasion for food an opportunity for pleasure and reward, the industry invites us to indulge a lot more often.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/13/obesity-salt-fat-sugar-kessler">guardian.co.uk</a></div>
