	Most people know that there is a free <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8">Kindle app</a> for iOS that will let you read books from Amazon's Kindle store. Apple also offers a free <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8">iBooks</a> app. Fewer people have heard of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenberg</a>, where you can download over 30,000 free books, and fewer still have heard of the <a href="http://www.freekindlebooks.org/MagicCatalog/magiccatalog.html">Magic Catalog</a> from <a href="http://www.freekindlebooks.org/">FreeKindleBooks.org</a>.</p>
<p>
	The "Magic Catalog" isn't where Harry Potter shops -- it's a "book" containing nothing except links to other books. You can use the search feature of your favorite e-book reader to look for books; with a few taps, you can have the new book on your iOS device without ever needing to go through iTunes and without spending a penny.</p>
<h3>
	The easy way</h3>
<p>
	If you already have the iBooks or Kindle apps installed, simply go to <a href="http://www.freekindlebooks.org/MagicCatalog/magiccatalog.html">Magic Catalog</a> on your iOS device and tap the appropriate link for whichever app you are using (MOBI Edition for Kindle, EPUB Edition for iBooks).</p>
