<blockquote>
<p>Hacker group Anonymous and the People's Liberation Front have created a data-sharing site called <a href="http://www.AnonPaste.tk">AnonPaste</a>, meant to host pastes of code and other messages without any moderation or censorship of the information posted. The new site, which uses a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en">free .tk web address</a>, allows users to set a time for the paste to expire. It claims that data is encrypted and decrypted in the browser using 256 bits AES, so the server doesn't see any of the information included in the paste.The site says it's taking donations in the form of WePay or BitCoins.</p>

<p> The two groups launched AnonPaste as an alternative to the popular code-sharing site Pastebin, which has struggled to deal with its growing reputation as the popular hangout for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/slowloris-ddos-tool-used-by-anonymous-hacked-to-include-zeus-trojan.ars">malicious code </a>or <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/02/exposed-passwords-in-all-their-plain-text-glory.ars">stolen data</a>. Recently Pastebin has seen a huge growth in traffic, but it's also faced increasing DDOS attacks—one in <a href="http://pastebin.com/eJqhCjca">February</a> used over 20,000 unique IP addresses alone.</p>
