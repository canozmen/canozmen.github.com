<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Now the really important bit. Scaf foisted a deputy prime minister on to Sharaf: Dr Ali el-Selmi. A few weeks ago Selmi proposed that before elections all parties should sign up to a constitutional declaration that would, among other things: make the budget of the armed forces (including all arms deals) secret from parliament, government and president; and assign to the armed forces the role of "protecting the civil nature of the state". So the armed forces could basically overthrow any government they didn't like â€“ while acting within the constitution.</p><p>Even more importantly: an appendix to this declaration says that Scaf may send any draft constitution back to the drawing board at any time; and that, if the founding committee fails to produce an agreed constitution within three months, Scaf may appoint its own committee to write it themselves.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/22/egypt-military-government-enemy-revolution?cat=commentisfree&amp;type=article">guardian.co.uk</a></div>
