<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">Kocasını metresinden veya kızını beğenmediği nişanlısından ayırmak isteyen Japonlar profesyonel &uml;wakaresaseya&uml; yani ayırıcılara gidiyorlarmış. Boşanmak i&ccedil;in delil arayan eşler ve &ccedil;alışanını istifaya zorlamak isteyen patronlar tarafından da kullanılıyorlarmış. Bu sefer işin sonu cinayetle bitmiş ama.</div>

<blockquote>
<div>Although Kuwabara inadvertently fell in love with Mrs Isohata, he had been  paid to track her down and seduce her as a professional wakaresaseya &mdash; or  &ldquo;splitter upper&rdquo; &mdash; hired by her husband to provide him with grounds for a  divorce.
<p>The case is raising questions about the ethics and legality of &ldquo;splitter  uppers&rdquo; &mdash; shady, but seemingly widespread operatives to whom a surprising  number of Japanese turn.</p>
<p>As Mrs Isohata&rsquo;s father said during the trial: &ldquo;I can never forgive a business  that toys with the emotions of human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wakaresaseya perform a variety of functions, but all of them arise from the  Japanese dislike of direct confrontation. Rather than pleading with him face  to face, a woman whose husband is having an affair may hire a splitter-upper  to seduce his mistress away from him. Parents may engage their services to  prise off the unsuitable lover of a son or daughter. Dozens of wakaresaseya  companies advertise on the internet, under names such as Lady&rsquo;s Secret  Service and Office Shadow. They employ models, actors and personable people  of different backgrounds first to trail and then to seduce their quarry. The  classic wakaresaseya operation was the one commissioned by Mrs Isohata&rsquo;s  husband.</p>

<p />
<div>Wakaresaseya (pronounced Wack-Array-Sass-Sayer) are private detectives who  bring to an end relationships of all kinds</div>
<p>As well as breaking up couples, entrapping someone into an affair can be  useful to an employer who wants to secure the &ldquo;resignation&rdquo; of an employee  or a businessman seeking &ldquo;favourable terms&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five years ago there were about a dozen companies, but there are now many more  on the internet. The industry relies upon the power of shame and is  unregulated</p>
<p>Cost is a question of time and complexity. An initial consultation might be  Y10,000 (&pound;71), but the average case takes three months and costs can easily  mount</p>
<p>The wakaresaseya say that men are the easiest targets. &ldquo;They never seem to  smell a rat when, despite the fact they&rsquo;re middle-aged, a beautiful young  woman falls for them,&rdquo; one said</p>
