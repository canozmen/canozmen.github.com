I haven’t it tried it myself but the new tea has been compared to lemon floor cleaner. As I’ve mentioned in my reviews before, I’m not a huge fan of bergamot flavoring for exactly this reason. There is nothing worse than a poorly done earl grey.&nbsp;Their original blend was beloved for many years and people tend to hate change. There is an old saying&nbsp; that always seems to ring true: if it ain't broke, don't fix it!&nbsp;Judging by the amount of public outcry, a change back to the old formula should probably be made in short order.</div></blockquote>
