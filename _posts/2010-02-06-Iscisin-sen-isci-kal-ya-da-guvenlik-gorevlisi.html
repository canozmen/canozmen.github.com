<div>In short, in a very unequal society, the people at the top have to spend  a lot of time and energy keeping the lower classes obedient and  productive. <p />  Inequality leads to an excess of what Bowles calls &ldquo;guard labor.&rdquo; In a  2007 paper on the subject, he and co-author Arjun Jayadev, an assistant  professor at the University of Massachusetts, make an astonishing claim:  Roughly 1 in 4 Americans is employed to keep fellow citizens in line  and protect private wealth from would-be Robin Hoods.<p />  The job descriptions of guard labor range from &ldquo;imposing work disc<img src="http://sfreporter.com/site_images_upload/upload/Newchart.jpg" align="left" height="307" alt="" width="450" />ipline&rdquo;&mdash;think  of the corporate IT spies who keep desk jockeys from slacking off  online&mdash;to enforcing laws, like the officers in the Santa Fe Police  Department paddy wagon parked outside of Walmart.<p />  The greater the inequalities in a society, the more guard labor it  requires, Bowles finds. This holds true among US states, with relatively  unequal states like New Mexico employing a greater share of guard labor  than relatively egalitarian states like Wisconsin.<p />  <br /> The problem, Bowles argues, is that too much guard labor sustains  &ldquo;illegitimate inequalities,&rdquo; creating a drag on the economy. All of the  people in guard labor jobs could be doing something more productive with  their time&mdash;perhaps starting their own businesses or helping to reduce  the US trade deficit with China.<p />  Guard labor supports what one might call the beat-down economy.  Community Action&rsquo;s Porter sees it all the time. <p />  &ldquo;We have based almost everything we have done on the idea that we always  need a part of our workforce that is marginalized&mdash;that we can call this  group into action at any time, pay them nothing and they will do  anything that needs to be done,&rdquo; she says.<p />  More discouraging, perhaps, is the statistical fact that a person born  into this workforce has little chance of rising beyond it.</div>

<p>&Ouml;zet olarak eşitsizlik endeksi (GNI) 45 civarı olan Amerika'da &ccedil;alışanların 4'te 1'inin &uml;guard labor&uml;yani polis, bek&ccedil;i, g&uuml;venlik g&ouml;revlisi olarak &uuml;retime sıfır katkı yaptıklarını g&ouml;stermişler. Makalede ayrıca Yunanistan'daki oranın daha da y&uuml;ksek olduğu g&ouml;r&uuml;l&uuml;yor. Ben GNI'si 43 civarı olan T&uuml;rkiye'de de benzer, hatta Yunanistan'dan bile y&uuml;ksek bir &uml;guard labor&uml; oranı &ccedil;ıkacağını tahmin ediyorum.</p>
