<p>Britain might not make steel anymore, or cars, or pop music worth listening to, but, boy, are we world-beaters when it comes to tyranny. And now classical music, which was once taught to young people as a way of elevating their minds and tingling their souls, is being mined for its potential as a deterrent against bad behavior.
</p><p>
In January it was revealed that West Park School, in Derby in the midlands of England, was "subjecting" (its words) badly behaved children to Mozart and others. In "special detentions," the children are forced to <a href="http://www.classissima.com/eng/news/113683-Bach-to-basics-regime-deters-school-troublemakers/" target="_blank">endure</a> two hours of classical music both as a relaxant (the headmaster claims it calms them down) and as a deterrent against future bad behavior (apparently the number of disruptive pupils has fallen by 60 per cent since the detentions were introduced.)
</p><p>
One news report says some of the children who have endured this Mozart authoritarianism now find classical music unbearable. As one critical <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1189998_opinion_andrew_grimes" target="_blank">commentator</a> said, they will probably "go into adulthood associating great music - the most bewitchingly lovely sounds on Earth - with a punitive slap on the chops." This is what passes for education in Britain today: teaching kids to think "Danger!" whenever they hear Mozart's Requiem or some other piece of musical genius.</p>
