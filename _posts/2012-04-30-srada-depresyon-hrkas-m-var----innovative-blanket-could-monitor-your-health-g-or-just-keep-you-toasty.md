> A network of tilt sensors in the shape of flowers and stems is embroidered into green taffeta fabric, allowing the blanket to wirelessly create a 3D model of itself on a computer in real time.
> 
> Lift a corner of the blanket, and the corner of the computer model lifts, too. Place it over someone sleeping, and the model would change when the person moves.
> 
> And by adding sensors for temperature, pressure, humidity and heart rate, it could become the ultimate comforter.
> 
> Too warm? The blanket monitoring your body temperature would command the thermostat to turn down, without you even noticing.
