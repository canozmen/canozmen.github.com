Bu İsrail kültürü nasıl bir savaş kültürüdür. Düşman algıları hiç bir zaman yok olmuyor gibi. İcat güzel ama.

> This butterfly does more than just fly around in the air. Just like any self-respecting UAV, it can also take color images and relay them back to ground control in real time. If you ever imagined what it would be like to be a fly on the wall at a critical moment, this butterfly can fulfill your dream. To explain how it works, Dubi Binyamini, head of IAI's mini-robotics department, takes out a helmet with a visor that looks like something from a science fiction movie and says, "When you put this on you are actually inside the butterfly's cockpit. You see what the butterfly sees. You can fly at any altitude and distance and see everything in real time."

> Israel is one of four countries that has delved into the world of insect spies. In the U.S. and South Korea, countries also involved in the development of this technology, most of the research is done by universities. In Holland, as in Israel, the military industries are also involved. Israel and Holland view the device not only as a topic of research, but also as a devastating weapon, or, at least a hard-to-detect intelligence agent.

> The electronic insect has a plain enough appearance. Nylon sheets are connected to hollow tubes that support several cog-wheels. The vehicle also includes several miniaturized electronic mechanisms. It flaps its wings 14 times per second and the speed at which it flies can be controlled using a small throttle installed on a remote control unit. Because holding the control unit and using the directional joystick at the same time is a bit difficult, in the current prototype the pilot needs to open and close the throttle using his or her chin. Binyamini believes that the simplicity of the design will enable any soldier to operate the butterfly.

> Michaeli, 17, is a high school student working with IAI engineers to develop the butterfly as part of his electronics courses at the IAI ORT technical school which he attends. He assembles and sometimes even pilots the vehicles. *"I have been flying unmanned aerial vehicles since I was a child. I stopped counting how many of those vehicles I crashed. Piloting the butterfly is a different story though. I am happy to say I haven't crashed a single butterfly to date, and I hope it stays that way,"* Michaeli said.

> *Besides developing weapons, Binyamini is the chairman of the Israeli Lepidopterists Society for butterfly and moth enthusiasts*. His love for the flying insects began at the age of nine, and he has since then chased after them all across the globe, from the Saudi Arabian border through mine fields near the Hermon mountain and 4,000 feet above ground in the Andes mountains.

> Guy Marom, a development engineer who has become the leading butterfly pilot, related a humorous anecdote. "On one occasion, our butterfly flew at an altitude of 50 meters and simply ran away. At that point, we saw a flock of birds lower altitude and join it in flight. This has happened several times since then. If we fly a larger butterfly, birds will join it and let it lead the group. If we fly a smaller butterfly, insects will join it and you can see a trail of black dots behind it."

> *According to Marom, copying nature has its negative side as well. "When we fly the butterfly near cats, they begin to wag their tales nervously and keep their eyes on it."*
> 
> Binyamini adds a particular bird to the list of the artificial butterfly's enemies. "If our butterfly passes by a nest of spur-winged plover birds, the birds simply attack it."
