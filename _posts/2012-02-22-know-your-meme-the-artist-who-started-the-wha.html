Does the term “meme-ification” of culture speak to you in any way?</em></p><p><strong>GH:&nbsp;</strong>In my own art practice, I try to create projects that have a popular appeal to them; &nbsp;I build my studio projects in a way that can be communicated through a viral-like structure. However, I don’t really make studio projects that can be quickly emulated —&nbsp;they tend to be time-intensive and laborious.</p><p>In terms of “meme-ification,” I think that memes function as an insider language for different cultural groups on Facebook. Memes are small treasures that people find on the internet that they take pride in sharing —&nbsp;or modifying and sharing —&nbsp;with their friends. Memes play a role in forming a communication format that people can riff-off of, and expand on in order to include themselves in the cultural group. In comparison to earlier forms of communication, I think memes operate like Fan Fiction or Zines, where people can modify and circulate media within a group and thereby participate in that culture.</p></blockquote>
