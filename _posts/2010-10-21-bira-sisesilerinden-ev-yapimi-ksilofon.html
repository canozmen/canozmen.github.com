<p>On the back of each bottle is a guide for musical key-making. You simply fill the bottle with water to the appropriate line, and it will produce that key when struck. With what, you ask? With special batons that come in the box– you make them with the corks from the bottle tops! The bottles can be arranged in a musical line by unfolding the six-pack. Two six-packs make a full octave.  Fun times. More <a href="http://www.inhabitots.com/2009/08/10/the-recycled-toy-sculptures-of-robert-bradford/">toys from things</a>, please!</p></blockquote>
