Okumadım daha ama tam bir yaz kitabı havası var.

> Thematically, none of this is particularly new. But the science fiction world Garth Nix creates is just audacious enough to seem fresh. I like the idea of teens or pre-teens devouring this book, and then, years later reading Dune or Foundation. I like the idea of them debating which one is better. For my money, I know Dune and Foundation are probably better pieces of art. But A Confusion of Princes is extremely fun to read, and possibly more entertaining than those famous novels. And what’s wrong with a little entertainment?
