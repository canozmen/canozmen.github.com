<br />
<p>Cities are pushing beyond their limits and are merging into new massive conurbations known as mega-regions, which are linked both physically and economically. Their expansion drives economic growth but also leads to urban sprawl, rising inequalities and urban unrest.</p>
<p>The biggest mega-regions, which are at the forefront of the rapid urbanisation sweeping the world, are:
</p><ul>
<li>Hong Kong-Shenhzen-Guangzhou, China, home to about 120 million people;</li>
<li>Nagoya-Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe, Japan, expected to grow to 60 million people by 2015;</li>
<li>Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo region with 43 million people in Brazil.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
