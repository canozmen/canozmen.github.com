<h1>Online Periodicals</h1>
<p> <i>Clarkesworld</i></p>
<p>In this category, there’s no question what zine I rank in first place, in large part because of the excellent Yoon Ha Lee.  Besides her “Ghostweight” and “Conservation of Shadows”, Clarkesworld also published E Lily Yu’s “The Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees” as well as Gord Sellar’s “Trois Morceaux en Forme de Mechanika” and Genevieve Valentine’s “Semiramis”. </p>
<p><i>Subterranean Online</i></p>
<p>This publisher also put out an issue of its print magazine in 2011, but I did not receive a copy for review.  From the online zine, the highlights were “The Boy Who Followed Lovecraft” by Marc Laidlaw, “A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong” by K J Parker, and “White Lines on a Green Field” by Catherynne M Valente.</p>
<p><i>Apex</i></p>
<p>After spending about a year in the editor’s chair, Catherynne M Valente stepped back to the author position with the excellent “The Bread We Eat in Dreams.”  “The Speaking Bone” by Kat Howard was also a fine choice from editor Valente.</p>
<p><i>Fantasy Magazine</i></p>
<p>This one slipped in my estimation under the new editorial  hand for 2011, as well as cutting in half the number of original stories.  My favorite was from An Owowmoyela, “Of Wolves and Men”.</p>
<p><i>Lightspeed</i></p>
<p>I’ve never been able to find much enthusiasm for most of the soft SF published here, but it did well with Robert Reed’s “Woman Leaves Room”.</p>
<p><i>Redstone SF</i></p>
<p>In contrast, Redstone’s science fiction is always the hard stuff, but the literary quality has sometimes been low.   Two good ones were “Like a Hawk in Its Gyre” by Philip Brewer and “Evoë! Evoë!” by Robert Pritchard.</p>
<p><i>Strange Horizons</i></p>
<p>Among a lot of rather similar stories, I saw one real standout:  Gavin J Grant’s “Widows in the World”</p>
<p><i>Beneath Ceaseless Skies</i></p>
<p>From this zine, I liked the strangeness of “Walls of Paper, Soft as Skin” by Adam Calloway</p>
<p><i>Intergalactic Medicine Show</i></p>
<p>Orson Scott Card’s bimonthly zine seems predicated on edgelessness:  soft, safe stories.  I was, however, quite happy to read Jeffry Lyman’s “The Hanged Poet.”</p>
<p><i>Tor.com</i></p>
<p>I never know what I’m going to find at this site, which leads to some really happy surprises like Paul Park’s verse “Ragnarok.”  Also recommended, Michael F Flynn’s AH “The Iron Shirts”</p>
<p><i>GigaNotaSaurus</i></p>
<p>Although supposedly dedicated to longer fictions, the zine disappointed with a run of short stories in mid-year.   I recommended “Work, With Occasional Molemen” by Jeremiah Tolbert.</p>

<h1>Anthologies</h1>
<p>I received more of these for review this year, although not all the anthologies I would have most liked to see.  Here are the highlights of the anthology year, which fell into two general categories</p>
<p>It seemed that every other volume in 2011 was labeled “urban fantasy.”  From which I conclude that there is no agreement on the boundaries of this subgenre, or just what kind of stories it actually includes.  There is the elfy sort;  the ass-kicking vampire-lover sort, crossbred with romance;  the detectivey sort, crossed with mystery.  <i>Caveat lector.</i></p>
<p><b>Subterranean:  Tales of Dark Fantasy 2</b>, edited by William Schafer</p>
<p>A high quality collection showcasing authors published by this small press.  The fantasy ranges from light to horrific dark, which is the tone of my favorite, Norman Partridge’s western-themed “Vampire Lake.”  </p>
<p><b>Naked City</b>, edited by Ellen Datlow</p>
<p>One of the strongest of the year’s urban fantasy anthologies, in which the editor has chosen to emphasize the urban settings in which the stories take place.  Among these, I particularly liked Kit Reed’s “Weston Walks”, Lavie Tidhar’s “The Projected Girl”, and Jeffrey Ford’s “Daddy Long Legs of the Evening”.</p>
<p><b>Ghosts by Gaslight</b>, edited by Jack Dann and Nick Gevers</p>
<p>The title accurately reflects the contents of these works:  Victorian ghost stories.  Best was Paul Park’s New Orleans-themed “Mysteries of the Old Quarter”. </p>
<p><b>Down These Strange Streets</b>, edited by Gardner Dozois and George RR Martin</p>
<p>This interpretation of urban fantasy centers on the murder mystery.  My favorites were “The Bleeding Shadow” by Joe R Lansdale and “The Adakian Eagle” by Bradley Denton.</p>
<p><b>Blood and Other Cravings</b>, edited by Ellen Datlow</p>
<p>Vampires, mostly the psychic or metaphorical sort.  I liked “Miri” by Steve Rasnic Tem.</p>
<p>I also saw a lot of science fiction anthologies, which proved overall to be a better showcase for SF than the zines.</p>
<p><b>Engineering Infinity</b>, edited by Jonathan Strahan</p>
<p>A good collection of hard science fiction from a strong lineup of authors.  My choices were “Malak” by Peter Watts, “Laika’s Ghost” by Karl Schroeder, and “A Soldier of the City” by David Moles</p>
<p><b>Welcome to the Greenhouse</b>, edited by Gordon Van Gelder</p>
<p>An SF anthology on the theme of global climate change.  A varied mix of stories, tragic to comic.  The best, on the tragic side, was Brian W Aldiss’s “Benkoelen”.</p>
<p><b>Eclipse Four</b>, edited by Jonathan Strahan</p>
<p>Unthemed, genre-inclusive anthology, latest in this well-received series.  Caitlín R Kiernan had a superior SF story: “Tidal Forces”.</p>
<p><b>Panverse 3</b>, edited by Dario Ciriello</p>
<p>The third volume of this collection of novellas was the best yet, and, sadly, will apparently also be the last.   The stories were almost all science fiction.  Especially good were Tochi Onyebuchi’s “Dust to Dust” and Ken Liu’s “The Man Who Ended History”.</p>
<p><b>Solaris Rising</b>, edited by Ian Whates</p>
<p>More science fiction, another strong group of stories.  My picks are “The Best Science Fiction of the Year Three” by Ken MacLeod,  “The Lives and Deaths of Che Guevara” by Lavie Tidhar, and “At Play in the Fields” by Steve Rasnic Tem.</p>
