<p>Okul &ouml;ncesinden y&uuml;ksek lisans seviyesine kadar gidecek, yetişkinlere y&ouml;nelik bir dizi olacakmış. "Ya hocam bunlar ger&ccedil;ek hayatta ne işimize yarayacak" sorularına cevap verebilir mi bilmiyorum ama g&uuml;zel olacağa benziyor.</p>

<p>I have a friend who gets a tremendous kick out of science, even though he&rsquo;s an artist.  Whenever we get together all he wants to do is chat about the latest thing in evolution or quantum mechanics.  But when it comes to math, he feels at sea, and it saddens him.  The strange symbols keep him out.  He says he doesn&rsquo;t even know how to pronounce them.</p>
<p>In fact, his alienation runs a lot deeper. He&rsquo;s not sure what mathematicians do all day, or what they mean when they say a proof is elegant.  Sometimes we joke that I just should sit him down and teach him everything, starting with 1 + 1 = 2 and going as far as we can.</p>
<p>Crazy as it sounds, over the next several weeks I&rsquo;m going to try to do something close to that.  I&rsquo;ll be writing about the elements of mathematics, from pre-school to grad school, for anyone out there who&rsquo;d like to have a second chance at the subject &mdash; but this time from an adult perspective.  It&rsquo;s not intended to be remedial.  The goal is to give you a better feeling for what math is all about and why it&rsquo;s so enthralling to those who get it.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s begin with pre-school.</p>
