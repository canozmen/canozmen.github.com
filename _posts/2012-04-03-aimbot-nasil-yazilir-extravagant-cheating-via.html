</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">However in special cases you can do something clever. If the render call is for an enemy player then you can determine its screen position. In many cases that player may be behind world geometry and will either fail z-buffer checks or be covered by subsequent draw calls. Too late, the enemy screen location is known. At the end of the frame you can create a new draw call to DirectX to draw a box around that screen location. Boom, thatâ€™s a wallhack.</blockquote>via <a href="http://altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/02/extravagant-cheating-via-direct-x/">altdevblogaday.com</a>
