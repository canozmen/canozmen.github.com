      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The natural reaction that forms once a good developer recognizes his/her own value is to turn to either an individualist-mercenary mindset or a collectivist guild-like mindset.</p>
<p>The individualists turn into hard bargainers as they carefully probe their own market value and frequently re-negotiate relationships. They carefully invest in keeping their skill-base current and avoiding being shunted into the sunset end of the ecosystem for as long as possible. This sort of developer likes to hedge bets, stay invested in multiple projects and keep one foot in the open source world at all times. They position themselves for massive upsides when that is a possibility, and the ability to walk away from failures with their own reputations intact where there is real risk. There is a reason star mercenary technical talent is the asset that gets sold fastest in a fire-sale when a startup crashes. There is a mad scramble for a CTO who successfully manages to blame the business end for the failure.</p>
<p>The other kind of developer turns to guild-like structures, which serve as centers of balance-of-power politics&nbsp; in the constant wars against the developer-capitalists. Except that instead of taking on the dynamics of class warfare along an upper-lower dimension, the conflict takes the form of exit warfare along an inside-outside dimension. Rather than form a union to negotiate with management, the talented developer will simply exit a situation he/she does not like, and use guild-like resources to move to a better situation. Stock options are simply not as effective in limiting mobility as the power of Russian nobility to whip serfs into immobility once was.</p>
<p>The result is a precarious balance of power between developers and developer-capitalists, and a cyclic center-periphery flow of developer-capital, as individual developers take themselves in and out of circulation.</p>
<p>The result is a new kind of economics: Welcome to the world of Developeronomics.</p></blockquote>
