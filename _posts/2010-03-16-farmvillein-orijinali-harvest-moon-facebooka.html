      <p>Farmville oynamıyorum ama Harvest Moon'u Nintendo DS'te zevkle oynamıştım. Bunu da oynarım herhalde.</p><br />

                              <p><img src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/1003-16-harvest-moon.jpg" height="200" align="left" width="200" /><i>Harvest Moon</i>, which many consider as the inspiration to Facebook gaming king <i>FarmVille</i> from Zynga, will see several browser-based social game releases thanks to Japanese developer and publisher Marvelous Entertainment.</p>

<p>The company looks to put out five to six titles designed for social networking services, according to a report from the Nikkei Industrial Journal <a href="http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/03/16/marvelous_browser_games/">translated by</a> Andriasang. It's expecting to begin releasing those games this summer.</p>

<p>The 14-year-old series has seen dozens of releases, ports, and spin-offs on a multitude of home console, portable, digital download, and mobile platforms, so this move to spread the franchise to popular services like Facebook isn't surprising.</p>

<p>Marvelous didn't disclose any gameplay details behind the projects or specific strategies for attracting <i>FarmVille</i>'s 83 million fans to its own farming simulator, but the publisher says it "aims to use its game development knowhow to deliver full game experiences."</p>
