<p>We do have another old rule to help us: in the very first figure in chapter one of <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>, Frederick P. Brooks Jr. makes what I think is the most important point in his classic masterpiece. The figure illustrates that delivering "a programming product" is three times more effort than just making "a program," and that making "a programming system" is also three times the work of "a program," but that delivering "a programming systems product" is nine times—almost a magnitude—more work than just writing "a program."</p>
